Updated: 3/3/2015

Changes made to user stories:

- The customer told us on 3/2/2015 that we should not keep the user's password. Instead, we should conduct all logins via 3rd party authentication. We modiefied the make_new_account and user_login features to reflect that.
- We also deleted the View Offer user story because we realized that there was no action involved in that feature, and so we could combine it with other features.
